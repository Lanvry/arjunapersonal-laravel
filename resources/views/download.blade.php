                        now
                        the website is still running well. The aim of creating this website is that it includes a
                        lesson
                        schedule and homework donations when someone wants to give charity and share their homework
                        with
                        their friends. then it will be on the homework website, and the main goal is as a medium so
                        that
                        the lesson plans in our class are different from the others, only my class has a website
                        that
                        has been hosted.</p>
